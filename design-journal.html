        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>I hope that by the end of this class, HTML and CSS and coding as a whole concept don’t seem like such an enormous terrifying concept to swallow, but perhaps instead some slightly too big chunks of concepts that might still be scary but not as impossible to handle. I admire website design and I think that it is so incredibly cool but in this moment I can’t imagine it being something that I enjoy doing, let alone am good at. I hope by the end of this I am feeling a little differently and more optimistic but I’m also okay with just making it through the class in one piece! Honestly, this whole world is extremely new to me and I haven’t given much thought to it before this past week when courses started so I can’t say that I have any projects or technologies that I would like to be covered. As far as websites go, I feel I haven’t been visiting many of those recently either! I’ve been super busy painting the past few weeks, but in my spare time I do enjoy some online shopping, and one site in particular - Coming Soon NYC - has brought me some joy. I wouldn’t quite call them butterflies, but it’s a nice and fairly easy to navigate site. What gets me more than anything are their beautiful products and product photography. Being in the program has made me realize just how important and directly related to successful design photography is!

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>

        <p>For project one I am making a site inspired by the girl groups of the early 2000s and late 90s. I also am very inspired by clothing catalogs, teen magazines, and the general aesthetic of that time. I thought it might be fun to make up a fake girl group name for the house that I live in, and design a site around my three roommates and myself as if we were the members of this imaginary group. This week we will all style ourselves as our personas and I will art direct a shoot so that I have content for the photos that will be on the site. On top of those photos, I want to have fun stickers and maybe even handwritten elements to make it really feel like the time period. The content for copy will be very silly and surface level snippets about each member of the house.</p>
        
        <p>I think I’ll be able to really tie together a visual style with a color palette and with the style and treatment of the photos. For the sake of time I will be using a digital camera but I want to buck up and use Photoshop so that I can make the images look textured like film photo or scanned photos, and I will have images cut out to help add to the general aesthetic of the site. For type I need to do some more research on typefaces of the early 2000s but I already have a general feel in mind for some fun bubbly decorative typefaces paired with pretty basic body type.<p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>I imagine that the only users will be myself and my roommates which is a very fun audience to be working with. Besides that though, maybe they are a twenty something person who stumble upon the website. This person is drawn to the bright colors of the webpage because they work a boring job to pay the bills but love art and design and have always dreamt of being creative for a living. Their hair was dyed a bright blue before Covid hit and has faded to a cool toned silver. They are petting their dog named Frank and sipping on a blue raspberry slurpee as they browse the site.</p>
