        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>I hope that by the end of this class, HTML and CSS and coding as a whole concept don’t seem like such an enormous terrifying concept to swallow, but perhaps instead some slightly too big chunks of concepts that might still be scary but not as impossible to handle. I admire website design and I think that it is so incredibly cool but in this moment I can’t imagine it being something that I enjoy doing, let alone am good at. I hope by the end of this I am feeling a little differently and more optimistic but I’m also okay with just making it through the class in one piece! Honestly, this whole world is extremely new to me and I haven’t given much thought to it before this past week when courses started so I can’t say that I have any projects or technologies that I would like to be covered. As far as websites go, I feel I haven’t been visiting many of those recently either! I’ve been super busy painting the past few weeks, but in my spare time I do enjoy some online shopping, and one site in particular - Coming Soon NYC - has brought me some joy. I wouldn’t quite call them butterflies, but it’s a nice and fairly easy to navigate site. What gets me more than anything are their beautiful products and product photography. Being in the program has made me realize just how important and directly related to successful design photography is!

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>

        <p>For project one I am making a site inspired by the girl groups of the early 2000s and late 90s. I also am very inspired by clothing catalogs, teen magazines, and the general aesthetic of that time. I thought it might be fun to make up a fake girl group name for the house that I live in, and design a site around my three roommates and myself as if we were the members of this imaginary group. This week we will all style ourselves as our personas and I will art direct a shoot so that I have content for the photos that will be on the site. On top of those photos, I want to have fun stickers and maybe even handwritten elements to make it really feel like the time period. The content for copy will be very silly and surface level snippets about each member of the house.</p>
        
        <p>I think I’ll be able to really tie together a visual style with a color palette and with the style and treatment of the photos. For the sake of time I will be using a digital camera but I want to buck up and use Photoshop so that I can make the images look textured like film photo or scanned photos, and I will have images cut out to help add to the general aesthetic of the site. For type I need to do some more research on typefaces of the early 2000s but I already have a general feel in mind for some fun bubbly decorative typefaces paired with pretty basic body type.<p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>I imagine that the only users will be myself and my roommates which is a very fun audience to be working with. Besides that though, maybe they are a twenty something person who stumble upon the website. This person is drawn to the bright colors of the webpage because they work a boring job to pay the bills but love art and design and have always dreamt of being creative for a living. Their hair was dyed a bright blue before Covid hit and has faded to a cool toned silver. They are petting their dog named Frank and sipping on a blue raspberry slurpee as they browse the site.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Considering these articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.
        <p>1. Acknowledge it</p>
        <p>2. Lean into it for a little </p> 
        <p>3. Accept that it is part of the process </p>
        <p>4. Take some space away from the task at hand </p>
        <p>5. Express it, talk about it with others. </p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
        <p>I chose this business because I wanted to select a local Black owned business. I thikn that my redesign will just be cleaner/more straightforward than the existing website. The business is new and just moving past the Instagram selling stage and so it has some cleaning up to do which makes sense. My goals will be to highlight the menu and the story of the brand, and maybe some product photos as well because there are some beautiful ones!</p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00
          " target="_blank"> this article</a> on mobile-first design and share your thoughts on mobile-first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p>I think that mobile first makes so much sense. In this digitally evolving world, the natural instinct should be to design for the least advanced interface first (mobile) and then work your way up. I can't count how many times I've lost interest in a brand/company/whatever because they have a horribe website, and most of the time my first impression of a website is when I'm viewing it from my phone. I think when you have a really nice mobile website it makes a huge difference. Not only this, but designing for mobile first is also designing to be more accessible, considering mobile phones have more sales than desktop at this point. All in all it just makes sense to me that mobile first would be the way to design!</p>

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This one's about "why." Read <a href="https://addicted2success.com/life/why-knowing-your-why-is-your-greatest-tool-for-success/" target="_blank"> this article</a> (try to pretend it's not a cheezy article about business success). Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article. OR If that's too challenging right now, consider people in your life or people who've inspired you. Think about what drives them, what their "why" is. Why did they work so hard to do XYZ, was it from past experiences they had, was it because they saw a need they were called to fill? What's their deeper "why?" Ask them if you know them, or look up some biographical information and try to figure it out. Write about either you or your inspiration</p>
        <p>I've been questioning my "why" for this whole term. When I entered design, my "why" was that I was too scared to be an art practice major (or that's what I thought it was) and design seemed like a cool way to do art but work around my fears and insecurities surrounding actually labling myself as an artist. Now, two and a half years later, my "why" has changed a lot. At the end of the day, I am becoming a designer because it is a tool, and a powerful one that can enact a lot of change. I'm doing it to learn new skills, meet new creatives, and open doors for myself. I am doing it because there needs to be more diversity in creative fields and design is a platform that I can use to uplift other Black and brown creatives. I'm doing it because it helps me communicate and understand things better for myself and for others. And I'm doing it because I wish there had been a badass Black woman designer to look up to when I was in high school trying to figure out how I could turn my creative energy into an actual job or life, and so I want to be that person.</p>
