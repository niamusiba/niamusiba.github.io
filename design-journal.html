        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:</p> I hope that by the end of this class, HTML and CSS and coding as a whole concept don’t seem like such an enormous terrifying concept to swallow, but perhaps instead some slightly too big chunks of concepts that might still be scary but not as impossible to handle. I admire website design and I think that it is so incredibly cool but in this moment I can’t imagine it being something that I enjoy doing, let alone am good at. I hope by the end of this I am feeling a little differently and more optimistic but I’m also okay with just making it through the class in one piece! Honestly, this whole world is extremely new to me and I haven’t given much thought to it before this past week when courses started so I can’t say that I have any projects or technologies that I would like to be covered. As far as websites go, I feel I haven’t been visiting many of those recently either! I’ve been super busy painting the past few weeks, but in my spare time I do enjoy some online shopping, and one site in particular - Coming Soon NYC - has brought me some joy. I wouldn’t quite call them butterflies, but it’s a nice and fairly easy to navigate site. What gets me more than anything are their beautiful products and product photography. Being in the program has made me realize just how important and directly related to successful design photography is!
