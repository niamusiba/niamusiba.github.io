<p>Mamey [mom-ayyye] is a Black owned, self-made, Portland-born brand that focuses on creating wellness that looks good, feels good, and tastes good. Mamey was created with the desire to share all the wonderful things plant-based & superfood wellness has taught me. Mamey products are consistently natural & easy, with the belief that wellness should be accessible, welcoming, and fiercely enjoyable for everyone. Weâ€™re focused on helping you step into your best self, from the inside out, starting with what we drink.  
</p> <p>P.S. I discovered wellness to be my passion around the time my dad passed away, so my hopes are to give you as much healing through your journey,  as it has given me through mine. Thank you for joining me on this journey.  We truly hope you love it.
